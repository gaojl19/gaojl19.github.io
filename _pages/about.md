I am a senior student at Computer Science Department, Tsinghua University. My research interests include **Reinforcement Learning**, **Robotics**, and **Deep Learning**. Specifically, I am mostly interested in designing reinforcement learning algorithms that can be directly applied on real robots, either through sample-efficient learning methods or sim-to-real transfer/generalizations.

<!-- I am currently seeking a phd . Please  -->
Iâ€™m currently **seeking Ph.D. positions in robotics/reinforcement-learning**. I am a highly motivated researcher and I have been enjoying research during my undergraduate years, and hope to spend my future years doing more significant and exciting research.

Projects
======
- Visual Imitation learning from videos (on going)
    - Aim to leverage the large amount of image and video data from the Internet to provide guidance for robot learning, to solve different levels of robot control problems, in simulation and real robot settings.
- Dual Representation for Preference Learning
    - Focus on designing sample-efficient preference learning algorithms that can achieve high performance in both oracle and human experiments.
    - Incorporate Scene graph as a high-level abstraction representation to facilitate better query selection algorithms in preference learning, which lead to SOTA performance in reward estimation.
- Concurrent Multi-task Learning
    - Come up with a new task setting where the demonstrator demonstrates multiple tasks in a single demonstration, and the algorithm tries to learn all separate tasks with these "concurrent" demonstrations.
    - Propose a EM-based Neural Network learning algorithm that can effectively learns separate tasks without requiring extra labels.
- Neuromorphic Computing
    - Explore the origin of CBRAM with High Linearity, ON/OFF Ratio, and State Number, which are crucial for a successful neuromorphic computation network(such as deep-learning neural networks) built from these CBRAMs as neurons.
    - Build a Powerful Neural Network using this CBRAM model as neurons which can solve the MNIST classification problem with SOTA performance(92%) compared to previous neuromorphic computation networks(80%).
