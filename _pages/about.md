I am a first-year master student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, working with **Prof.Fernando De La Torre** and **Dr.Joseph K J** on evaluation for vision language models. During my undergrad, I worked with **Prof.Huazhe Xu** at Tsinghua University on reinforcement learning. I have also collaborated with **Dr.Ruohan Zhang** at **Prof.Jiajun Wu**'s Lab at Stanford University on Human-robot interaction. I also spent a summer doing internship at Microsoft WebXT group, Bing Ads team.

Projects
======
- Robot Learning with Text-to-Image Generation Models
    - Explore the possibility of **utilizing the knowledge embedded in pre-trained text2image diffusion models to provide visual guidance for robot learning**, without any expert demonstrations or human-designed reward functions.
    - Propose a pipeline using image editing techniques to generate visual goals for example-based visual RL, and experiments in simulation and real-world validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- Dual Representation for Robot Learning under Human Guidance
    - Focus on designing **sample-efficient preference learning algorithms** that can achieve high performance in both oracle and human experiments.
    - Incorporate **scene graph as a high-level abstraction representation** to facilitate better query selection algorithms in preference learning, which lead to SOTA performance in reward estimation.

- Concurrent Multi-task Learning
    - Come up with a new task setting, **"concurrent multi-task learning"**,  where the demonstrator demonstrates multiple tasks in a single demonstration, and the algorithm tries to learn all separate tasks with these "concurrent" demonstrations.
    - Propose a **EM-based Neural Network** learning algorithm that can effectively learns separate tasks without requiring extra labels.
    
- Neuromorphic Computing
    - Explore **the origin of CBRAM with High Linearity, ON/OFF Ratio, and State Number**, which are crucial for a successful neuromorphic computation network(such as deep-learning neural networks) built from these CBRAMs as neurons.
    - Build a Powerful Neural Network using this CBRAM model as neurons which can solve the MNIST classification problem with SOTA performance(92%) compared to previous neuromorphic computation networks(80%).
