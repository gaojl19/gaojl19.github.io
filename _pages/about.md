I am a senior student at Computer Science Department, Tsinghua University. My research interests include **Reinforcement Learning**, **Robotics**, and **Deep Learning**. Specifically, I am mostly interested in designing reinforcement learning algorithms that can be directly applied on real robots, either through model-based methods or sim-to-real transfer/generalizations.

<!-- I am currently seeking a phd . Please  -->

Projects
======
- Efficient Imitation Learning
    - Designing robot learning algorithms that are sample-efficient in terms of both demonstration data and online interaction times, which can directly be used for training on real robots.
- Dual Representation for Preference Learning
    - Incorporate Scene graph as a high-level abstraction representation to facilitate better query selection algorithms in preference learning.
- Concurrent Multi-task Learning
    - Come up with a new task setting where the demonstrator demonstrates multiple tasks in a single demonstration, and the algorithm tries to learn all these tasks with these "concurrent" demonstrations.
    - Propose a EM-based Neural Network learning algorithm that can effectively learns separate tasks without requiring extra labels.
- Neuromorphic Computing
    - Explore the origin of CBRAM with High Linearity, ON/OFF Ratio, and State Number
    - Builind Powerful Neural Network using this CBRAM model as neurons which can solve the MNIST classification problem with up to 93% accuracy.
